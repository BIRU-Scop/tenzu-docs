# Configuration

Let's explore the different Helm chart configurations.

## Charts

Tenzu offers three different charts:

1. [tenzu-back](https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tenzu-back): Helm deployment for the backend part only.
2. [tenzu-front](https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tenzu-front): Helm deployment for the frontend part only.
3. [tenzu](https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tenzu): A global chart that contains the two previous charts and, if needed, Bitnami Postgres and Bitnami Redis.

## Tenzu Back

### Default Values

Here are the default values for the chart. It contains comments on every element, so please check the file directly.

To work correctly, you must provide values for `email`, `global.tenzu`, and credentials for `postgres` and `redis`.

Please note that `TENZU_SECRET_KEY` and `TENZU_TOKENS__SIGNING_KEY` are randomly generated by default. You can set the value through `tokenSigninKey` and `secretKey`.

You can also enable `sentry` tracking with the `sentry` dictionary.

```yaml reference title="default-back-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu-back/values.yaml
```

### Example with External Databases

Here is an example of values that you can use if you have external database credentials stored in secrets.

```yaml reference title="example-external-db-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu-back/secret-values-example.yaml
```

### Example with Global Values

Here is an example of the values of the chart with database credentials passed through globals to share the information between charts. In this example, the ingress is also exposed.

```yaml reference title="example-direct-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu-back/flat-values-example.yaml
```

## Tenzu Front

### Default Values

Here are the default values for the Tenzu Front chart. It's a simple Caddy app, so nothing is really mandatory. Please note that you can configure `sentry` and an `ingress`.

```yaml reference title="default-front-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu-front/values.yaml
```

### Example Values with Ingress

Here is an example of the chart with an ingress object.

```yaml reference title="example-front-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu-front/example-values.yaml
```

## Tenzu

### Default Values

The default values of the Tenzu meta chart mainly use the defaults of the two previous charts.

Please note that by default it contains the Bitnami charts for `postgres` and `redis`, which you can disable by changing the values of `postgres.enabled` and `redis.enabled`.

```yaml reference title="default-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu/values.yaml
```

### Example with Databases Included

You can use these values as an example if you want to deploy Tenzu with the Bitnami databases.

```yaml reference title="tenzu-bitnami-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu/external-example.yaml
```

### Example with External Databases

You can use these values as an example if you want to deploy only the Tenzu charts.

```yaml reference title="tenzu-external-values.yaml"
https://github.com/BIRU-Scop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/tenzu/external-example.yaml
```
